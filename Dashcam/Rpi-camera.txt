Taking a Picture

To capture the picture, type the following command in the terminal.

    raspistill -o pic.jpg

This will capture the image after 5 seconds. You will also see a preview while capturing the picture or video  if you are using an external or any other device connected through the HDMI cable. If you are controlling your Raspberry pi through the Remote connection, then you will not see the preview window.

If you want to capture the picture after some specific time, then use the following command. Enter the time in milliseconds after ‘-t’.

    raspistill -t 10000 -o pic1.jpg

If you just want the preview. Then use the below command

    raspistill -p -o

Now if you want to apply a vertical flip while capturing the image, then use the following command.

    raspistill -vf -o pic2.jpg

If you want to apply a horizontal flip while capturing the image, then use the following command.

    raspistill -vh -o pic3.jpg

If you want to apply both horizontal and vertical flip while capturing the image, then use the following command.

    raspistill -vf -vh -o pic4.jpg

The picture are captured at the default resolution. If you want to capture the image at different resolution, then use the below command.

    raspistill -o pic5.jpg -w 640 -h 480

If you want to capture the image in ‘.png’ format, then use the following command

    raspistill -o pic6.png -e png

Python code to capture the image

Now if you want to capture the image using the python code, then you will require a library for the camera module. So run the following command in the terminal and your library will installed.

    sudo apt-get install python-picamera

To capture the image using python code, run the following code in the python file.

    import picamera     # Importing the library for camera module
    from time import sleep
    camera = picamera.PiCamera()    # Setting up the camera
    camera.start_preview()
    sleep(5)
    camera.capture('/home/pi/Desktop/picture/imag.jpg') # Capturing the image
    camera.stop_preview()
    print('Done')

To rotate the image, use the following code.

    import picamera     # Importing the library for camera module
    from time import sleep
    camera = picamera.PiCamera()    # Setting up the camera
    camera.rotation = 180
    camera.start_preview()
    sleep(5)
    camera.capture('/home/pi/Desktop/picture/imag.jpg') # Capturing the image
    camera.stop_preview()
    print('Done')

To add text to the image, use the following code

    import picamera     # Importing the library for camera module
    from time import sleep
    camera = picamera.PiCamera()    # Setting up the camera
    camera.start_preview()
    camera.annotate_text = 'Picture Taken with Raspberry camera'
    sleep(5)
    camera.capture('/home/pi/Desktop/picture/imag.jpg') # Capturing the image
    camera.stop_preview()
    print('Done')

Recording a video with Raspberry pi camera module

To record a video, type the following command in the terminal. It will record a video of 5 seconds. The video will be saved in the ‘.h264’ format.

    raspivid -o video.h264

You can also record the video while flipping horizontally or vertically using ‘-vh’ and ‘vf’ like we did while capturing the image.

To record video while flipping horizontally.

    raspivid -vh -o video1.h264

To record video while flipping vertically.

    raspivid -vf -o video2.h264

To record the video for specific time. Following command will record the video for 15 seconds.

    raspivid -o video3.h264 -t 15000

Now if you want to watch the video you have recorded, then you will have to install the video player. Type the following command to install it.

    sudo apt-get install omxplayer

Then go to the directory where you have saved the video and type the following command. Replace ‘video’ in the following command with you video file name.

    omxplayer video.h264

It may actually play at a faster speed than what has been recorded, due to omxplayer’s fast frame rate.
Python code for Recording Video

To record the video using the python code, type the below code in the python file. You will not see the preview window if you are controlling the raspberry pi through SSH connection.

    import picamera     # Importing the library for camera module
    from time import sleep  # Importing sleep from time library to add delay in program
    camera = picamera.PiCamera()    # Setting up the camera
    camera.start_preview()      # You will see a preview window while recording
    camera.start_recording('/home/pi/Desktop/video.h264') # Video will be saved at desktop
    sleep(5)
    camera.stop_recording()
    camera.stop_preview()
